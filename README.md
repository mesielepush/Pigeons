This is a simulation of an experimental desing by Richard Herrstein.
    
    HERRNSTEIN R. J. (1961).
    Relative and absolute strength of response as a function of frequency of reinforcement.
    Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior, 4(3), 267-72. 

The paper rest on the early theory of choice in the realm of Behaviour Analisys.

It hypothesizes the relative frequency of response as a dependent variable to frequency of reinforcement.
It is ussually taken as the beggining for the development of what is call the Matching Law.
And it is in turn a precursor work for the Delay Reduction Theory by Edmund Fantino.
