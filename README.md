This is a simulation of an experimental desing by Richard Herrstein.

## Experimental Desing
The paper verses around the theory of choice, it hypothesys the frequency of response as a dependent variable of frequency of reinforcement.
It is ussually taken as the beggining for the development of what is call the Matching Law.

And it is in turn a precursor work for the Delay Reduction Theory by Edmund Fantino.
